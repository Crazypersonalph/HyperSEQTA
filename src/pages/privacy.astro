<p>BetterSeqta is an application in which it allows the user to configure the CSS and the functionality of the Seqta page to their liking. This program does not collect any user information (other than the settings a user configures), and it doesn't share it either. With regards to the settings a user configures, this is only collected and stored on the local user's computer, as a way of storing the settings for future use. That is the only way user information is directly collected and used by BetterSeqta. I would like to reiterate that BetterSeqta does not share any of your information with any third-party. Not in the past, not now, and not ever.</p>
